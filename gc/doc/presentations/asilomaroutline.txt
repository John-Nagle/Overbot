The need for better perception technology

- vision - hard AI problem
- submillimeter radar - hard electronics problem
- LIDAR - hard profitability problem

LIDAR line scanners
- Work fine
- Off the shelf products almost there
- Small volume products
- Hard to assemble 3D image from line scanner while bouncing around

CMU's approach
- Line scanner in huge 3-axis stabilized gimbal
- Works, marginally, but clearly not suitable for production

Our first approach
- Line scanner in huge 1-axis servoed gimbal on shock mounts
- Marginal

LIDAR area scanners
- True 3D camera
- Short-range all electronic devices exist
- Longer range devices require scanning to overcome square law
- Existing 3D scanners are one-off mechanical kludges

If this is to become a production technology for civilian
and military automatic driving, we need a technology that
can be built in volume at low cost.

Rough design for a solid state area scanner
- MEMS mirror for outgoing beam
- Array of PIN diodes for detector

Custom detector chip needed
- Array of PIN diodes, maybe avalanche diodes
- Not necessarily one per pixel
- Sunlight on some pixels must not wipe out adjacent pixels
- Diodes must be small, low-capacitance to 
- Per-pixel logic must gate 200ps risetime signal to timer.
