I've attached the spec sheet on the connectors used on the motor.  The motor
uses part numbers:  MS3112E14-19P and MS3112E14-8P.

You'll want to get the MS3112F14-19S for the sensor cable and MS3112F14-8S
for the motor connector.

I'm also looking at different ways to incorporate a hard stop for the
system.

The maximum continuous current for the motor is 1.8 Amps.
The maximum peak current is 5.5 Amps.
The gear ratio used is 72:1.
