Notes to E-stop

26 JUL 2004	J. Nagle

Removed old E-stop red button wiring.  Replaced
E-stop wiring with four wires to each button.  A N/C switch
(red) in each button is connected to the red and black wires
in the four wire cable, and each red button is connected
separately to J10.

Each E-stop button also has a N/O switch, connected to the
green and white wires.  These are paralleled under the hood,
and wired to the STOP input of the generator.  

So pressing any of the vehicle's red E-stop buttons will trip the
E-stop and stop the generator engine.

This creates a problem, though. The E-stop system is currently
powered from the generator, and the brakes do not get fully
applied before the generator stops. So the E-stop box needs
backup power.

This will be provided via a pair of diodes, so backup power can
come from either the vehicle battery or the generator.
