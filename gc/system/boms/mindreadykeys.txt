Tney're installed into the lla1394libMulti.so and lla1394libMulti.a files with "licgui".
Only install into one file per "licgui" session; the program is broken.
Up to eight keys can be installed into one copy of the .so and .a files, so it's
possible to put all keys into all copies, for portability.

   The motherboard and FireWire chip bound to LLA
license serial number SN 20024026 has failed.  Attached
is a confirmation from the manufacturer of the system.
We would like that serial number unlocked in your database
so we can bind it to the replacement motherboard, or 
to receive a new key for the replacement board

   The replacement board is

Installing 1394-OHCI adapter 000000:008A003B91... FAILED (Bad licence)

   We realize this is a hassle for you, but we did buy a total
of three licenses, only one of which we can actually use at
the moment.  From our side, it's a huge headache. We're going
to the DARPA Grand Challenge in a week, and we're down again.
