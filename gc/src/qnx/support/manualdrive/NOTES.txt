Manual driving works reasonably well.

Known problems:
-- USB joystick driver times out after a day of idle time. Joystick does not
   work again until unplugged and plugged back in. 
   
-- When the vehicle is power-cycled, the WiFi bridge loses its routing information.
   It's necessary to then either wait about five minutes for the ARP cache to
   time out, or execute the following commands as the super-user
   
   	arp -d gcsteer
   	arp -d gcbrake
   	arp -d gcthrottle

Beginnings of move server tester.

Basic concept: 
-- Enter move server mode.
-- Arm system.
-- Enter move parameters. (distance, max speed, 1/turn radius)
   -- turn radius prefilled from steering wheel
   -- 
-- Click to start move.
-- Click again to continue move with same distance to stop
-- Brake pedal and stop button on steering wheel still active and will
   abort move. 
-- Move server should use radar to prevent collisions.
-- Overrunning move limit will trigger E-stop.

Move server mode is internally quite different from manual driving mode.  
"manualdrive" talks to controllers only in read-only mode.  The move
server owns the controllers.

Who starts the move server? Where does it run?
What associated software comes up when the move server comes up?
Who resets the stall timer?  
Should this be a separate program?
