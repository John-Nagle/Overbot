Team Overbot Sonar Setup Description
Khian Hao Lim 11/4/03
---------------------------------------------

Required setup:
We wish to have about 16 sonars surrounding the vehicle. They should preferably be able to reach 3m
or more with fair amount of accuracy. The transducers and drive electronics that go with the 
transducers need to be water proof because they will be exposed. We hoped to be able to buy such units
off the shelf or make do with as little work. For accuracy, the transducers 
should be piezoelectric instead of electrostatic.

---------------------------------------------
Interface to system: 
See sensorclientserver.sxd in gc/system/milestones/sensorclientserver.sxd (open office document)
by checking out a copy from cvs.
There will be a SONAR server in software that talks to the sonar devices and constantly polls them for 
their distances. The SONAR server will respond to client queries and reply them with a suitable msg.

--------------------------------------------
Basic notes about sonars (see http://www.rdrop.com/~cary/html/ultrasonic.html)

- They are hard to interface with a pc. Their transducers (Polaroid, Murata, Prowave)
are widely available but they need drive electronics to go with them.

- The transducers are characterised by their range, their grades (whether instrument/environment grade),
their fan out angle

- The transducers are either electrostatic or piezoelectric (better accuracy).

- The transducers normally need some high voltage (20 - 100V) to send out ultrasonic waves at 40khz. 
Thats drive electronics are basically there to push voltage up to that level for the transducers to work.

-------------------------------------------
Possible sonars and electronics

Polaroid (http://www.senscomp.com/ultrasonic.htm)
- They make popular transducers commonly used in robotics. They have both electrostatic and waterproof
transducers. They make drive electronics (6500 module, http://www.senscomp.com/pdf/6500series.pdf)
that work with the transducers. But the 6500 module itself takes a ttl signal to work with. And we need one 6500
module with each transducer. So if we want to use them, we will need some electronics to drive this ttl signal. 
A prof at michigan makes an electronics board that talks to 6500 modules and is controllable by
serial Rs232 (http://www-personal.engin.umich.edu/~johannb/eeruf.htm, $1000, can talk to 16 transducer+6500 module at one time). 
Problem is the only suitable piezoelectric automotive grade
transducer is the 9000 series which cannot talk to the 6500 module right now.
However, it is still possible to use it with the 6500 module and requries changing some of the 
electronic components on the 6500 module (http://www.acroname.com/robotics/info/ideas/9000/9000.html)

Devantech (http://www.robot-electronics.co.uk/shop/Ultrasonic_Ranger_SRF082001.htm)
- They make a 3cm - 6m sonar module that has drive electronics with it. The drive electronics
talk I2C to other devices. I2C is a master slave bus digital protocol commonly used in video encoder,
eeprom circuits. We have RS232I2C converters that enable qnx computer to talk I2C. 
The transducers (www.prowave.com.tw ) are piezoelectric but problem is, they are not waterproof, 
The guys in UK that make the devantech units are waiting for water proof parts to arrive 
from www.prowave.com.tw to test 
(might be a few weeks from now). 

Automotive backup sensors:
- http://www.parking-sensor.com.tw and other automotive reversing sensors
- They normally go into beepers or visual displays of distances and are not meant for interfacing 
with pcs. We would need custom electronics to interface them
www.singtech.com.sg provided documentations, block diagrams, schematics for it

Murata:
- makes very good stick on or recessed versions of transducers commonly used in automotive backup
sensors. No drive electronics found for them.
http://search.murata.co.jp/Ceramy/owa/CATALOG.showcatalog?sHinnmTmp=MA40E7R&sLang=2&sNhnm=MA40E7R&sHnTyp=NEW
We would like to have parts MA40E7R and MA40E7S.
The distributors don't carry any of those and they will be made custom and shipped from
japan in 10 weeks.

Found MA40E7S-1 (http://www.murata.com/catalog/p19/el0560.pdf)
on revsersing sensor from http://www.gdpsensor.com/technical.asp.
Will try to integrate with SRF08 unit

Massasonic:
http://www.massa.com/datasheets/m500095.html
Way too expensive and hard to mount correctly because of shape

-----------------------------------------------
Things we tried or are trying:

- talked to www.singtech.com.sg and got documentations for their parking sensors (stopped trying; too
much work)

- currently: I have set up a SRF08 unit, with RS232toI2C convertor to talk to a qnx box. Still writing software
to get it to retrieve distance. See /gc/src/qnx/drivers/sonars in cvs. We hope to get the water proof
version of the transducers. The one that is on the devantech unit is 400SR160 from www.prowave.com.tw.
The one that is the waterproof is the 400ET180 (transmitter) with 400ER180 (receiver)
or 400ET250 with 400ER250. The problem is that they have different sizes and do not fit on the 
devantech circuit board. Another problem is we will need to water proof the whole circuit board.
We are waiting for the parking sensors to come. We will take out the transducers to try with the 
devantech circuit board to see if that works.

- possible alternative 1: see whether the 600 series electrostatic with the 6500 module is really worst
than the devantech piezo electric. Then we can get the board from Umich.

- possible alternative 2: get some 9000 series piezoelectric automotive grade transducers and
try to hack a 6500 module to get them to work. If that works, then we can get the board from umich.

---------------------------------------------
Things we have:

- 2 devantech SRF08 units (http://www.robot-electronics.co.uk/shop/Ultrasonic_Ranger_SRF082001.htm)

--------------------------------------------------
Packaging for use:

- shrink wrap sonar controllers in box, foam to compress it, label with
  slave address
- label box with sonar controller numbers within

--------------------------------------------------
Test:

- test that vehicle electrical noise did not create false signals for sonars
(insulate?)
