SOFAR for water sensor

-------------------------------------

We would like to have about 2 water detectors that sit at the wheel level of the chassis of the vehicle.
One would be slightly higher than the other. At the most basic level, they each need to tell the vehicle
computers a boolean value of whether it detects water right now or not. Ideally they would serial
RS232 but a ttl signal would do fine too and we will find ways to read the ttl signal.

-------------------------------------
General water detectors found:

- hobby alarm kits that detects water conductivity and starts beeping
- industrial strength water depth, conductivity sensors that are very expensive and
talk to their own custom electronics to give visual display
- home protection kits that detects water and beeps or talks to security systems

-------------------------------------
Looking at:

- industrial strength depth sensor (http://www.paroscientific.com/pdf/Series8000.pdf) that
  gives out RS232. Problem: 20 cm in length, 3 cm in diameter and possibly very expensive.

-------------------------------------
bought:

- a water detector circuit from http://www.electrodepot.com/i0660.htm 
needs separate circuit to work with it

- a toy hobby water detector circuit that detects water conductivity and starts beeping
gives out ttl signal
