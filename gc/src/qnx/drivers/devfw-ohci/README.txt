devfw-ohci

This is a Firewire/OHCI driver.

It's intended primarily to support FireWire cameras.

It currently uses Mindready code for low-level FireWire I/O, but
that may change.

This has been stable for some time.

Other than a problem with confusion when hot-plugging multiple cameras, it
seems to work fine.
