todo:

- firmware test and possibly revert if necessary
- make it stream by default (and recoverable by software)
- test ahrs with gcrear computer and power supply
- test ahrs integration
- test ahrs signs with no gps
- issues with grid north (llh), true north (vel), mag north (mag), find
- llh of starting point


optimization:
- use gps for yaw correction

- manual : http://www.overbot.com/public/devfw-ohci.html

look at for odometry:
http://www.acfr.usyd.edu.au/teaching/3rd-year/mech3700-Mx2/material/lectures/sensors/PDFs/dead_reck_sensors.pdf

- document the external interface (man page):
  - diagrams of ned
  - two norths
  - autopilot
  - refer to my ee report
  - how to run the program from comand line
  
- test logging and readback of data

tests:

- ahrs, gps when vehicle is on
- drive around with odometry (1st approximation without using steering angle)
  get circular accuracy test

possible problems:

- ahrs need startup time (5 min initially)
- gps need startup time (30 min initially)

- gps needs reacquisiton time (30 min)
- kf zeroing needs a known initial location


--------------------------------------------------
qns for gps:
- what does rtk really mean
- how does omnistar really work
- how does novatel really work

--------------------------------------------------
improvements:

- in gps loss, use map, vision to determine position
