Hello Khian Hao,

 Thank-you for that VERSION output message; that is exactly what I 
 needed.

 There are two items that require updating on this ProPak-LB unit;
 the OEM4-G2 firmware to version 2.130B5 and the iBoard DSP firmware
 to version 1.004b6.

 I have file attached to this email an archive that contains the
 .HEX files for both of these firmware updates, as well as the 
 WinLoad software that you can use to load the .HEX files onto the
 ProPak-LB unit.  There's also a general .TXT file that helps 
 describe how to load the OEM4 .HEX file; loading the DSP .HEX file
 is very similar except you do not require an authcode for it.

 Here is the OEM4 FW 2.130b5 authorization code that you will
 require to update the firmware on this ProPak-LB unit:

 PSN: SVA03300138
 Model: RT2WHPB
 Software Rev: 2.130B5
 Auth Code: 6138,077F,61D8,A17E,545A,RT2WHPB

 After you have updated both the OEM4 and the DSP .HEX files, make
 sure you do the FRESET command first so that the NVM table inside
 the ProPak-LB unit is formatted to match these new firmware 
 updates.

 Best Regards, Clint.

Hi Clint,

I emailed you previously about the beta firmware you mentioned for the 
propak lb to help with the reacquisition of omnistar hp.

My log version is:

Is that what you need? 

Hope to hear from you soon. Thanx
