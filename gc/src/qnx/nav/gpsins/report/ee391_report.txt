1) Introduction
   - team overbot (www.overbot.com) and darpa grand challenge and its status
   - intro on gps/ins integration, dead reckoning


2) AHRS unit
   - link to specs and doc
   - picture of mounting
   - specification (and what it really means in practice)
   - gyro view running (show art horizon, heading, yaw gyro noise)
   - traces:
	- static environment(in picture already)
	- when moving the unit on table top (accels and yaw)
	- double integrating acc's for position	

3) gps receiver
   - link to specs and doc
   - picture of receiver and antenna
   - picture of gpsolution
   - specs
   - time to cold start and require (single, vb, hp), firmware upgrade
   - traces: 
	- positions and sd in static environment (using waas)
	- positions and sd following circle (using waas)
	- positions and sd in static environment (using omnistar hp)
	- positions and sd following circle (using omnistar hp)
	- response times (single, hp) 
   - freq bending around 
   - talk about some of details on app notes on novatel:
	http://www.novatel.com/Documents/Bulletins/apn008.pdf
   - 

4) hardware mounting concerns
   - ahrs away from magnetic sources, neeed to water proof
   - gps antenna can see sky, antenna water proof
   - pictures?

5) software implementation concerns
   - qnx gui designed
   - kalman filter set up (and references)
	- equations and references
   - numerical improvements(from kalman filter engineering)
	- LU decomposition to solve Ax = B
	- making covariance matrix symmetric
   - use of STL

6) Integration into system
   - circle of uncertainty

6) testing and results
    - pictures (rubbermaid)
    - talk about circle and varying with gps truth
    - plots (steering angle == heading in this case)

7) future improvements
   - further integration with odometry, steering angle information
   - use fog gyro for double integration
   - using roadfollower, maps, odometry, steering angle to do dead reckoning
   - using inertial data for future state estimation of the vehicle (side slip)
   - kalman filter health monitoring (and others improvements in grewal book)
