README for speed server

This is the SPEED server. It controls brake, throttle, transmission, engine
start/run,  E-stop, and steering, in response to messages from
the MOVE server.

TODO:

	Dummy VORAD values are bad.  Y values seem inverted.	[DONE]
	Reset speed I-term when shifting, to avoid excessive accel on hills.
	Update state machine on timeouts when not in RUN mode, so pausing will work.
