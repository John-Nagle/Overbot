Speed server notes

2004-11-2

Starting from Achut's version.

Overhauled input message formats. Reasonably happy with those.

Design issues:
-- How do we run the speed server from manualdrive, for testing?
-- How do we run the speed server in simulation mode?
-- What code should be made common between manualdrive and the speed server?
-- How do we store tuning/configuration parameters?

-- Do we want to move some common code for the speed server and
   manualdrive to a common library?

Speed server will run and read chassis status, but doesn't issue any commands.

Speed control logic plan:

When the move server has no strong preferences about acceleration, it
should specify an acceleration of zero. This implies "cruise control" mode
- slow acceleration and deceleration. In fact, we will always
accelerate rather slowly in the initial version. 

If the requested speed is below the current speed and the acceleration 
is nonzero, braking will be performed to match the desired decel rate, based
on data from the INS.
